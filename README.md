# Django-React-TodoList

Hello guys, and welcome to my project!

The purpose of this project its to practice coding skills and learning more about React, Typescript and Django  

Innitialy i've imagined this project to be only a simple Todo List with some funcionality, but later i decided to improve the project with some data persistence, simulating some more real situation.
