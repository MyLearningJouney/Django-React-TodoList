# Django-React-TodoList

Hello guys, and welcome to my project!

The purpose of this project its to practice coding skills and learning more about React, Typescript and Django  

Innitialy i've imagined this project to be only a simple Todo List with some funcionality, but later i decided to improve the project with some data persistence, simulating some more real situation

Things i've learned doing this project so far:

 - Working with React and Functional Components.
 - Stabilishing communication from Front-end and Back-End
 - Forms Validation
 - React Hooks (Use State and Use Effect)
 - Retrieve and Post data (CRUD)
 - Typescript
 - CSS Modules
 - Working with SVG and animation
 - Creating an API
 - Configuring Django Backend
 - 

Things to improve:

 - Improve styles with some patterns/guide like SCSS to avoid repeat code
 - Some components could be more componetized 
 - Implement web responsive layout
 -
